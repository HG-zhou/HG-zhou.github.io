 A hypermedia document on the world wide web is called a page (foreign language: page). As an organization or individual on
 the web page called place the starting point for the home (foreign language: Homepage) or the home page, page usually contains
 pointers to other pages or other node (link), the so-called super link is a uniform resource locator (Uniform Resource Locator,
  English abbreviation: URL) pointer by activating (click) it can make easy access to new web browser. This is one of the most
  important reasons for HTML to be widely used. The organic collection, which is logically regarded as a whole series of pages,
  is called a web site (Website or Site). Hyper Text Markup Language (HTML) is a markup language designed for web page creation
  and other information that can be seen in web browsers.
 The essence of web pages is hyper text markup language, which can create powerful web pages by combining other Web technologies,
  such as scripting language, public gateway interfaces, components and so on. Therefore, the hypertext markup language is the basis
  of the Web programming, that is to say that the web is based on hypertext. The reason why hypertext markup language is called hypertext
   markup language is because it contains the so-called "hyperlink" point.
 <br><br>
Hyper text markup language is an application under the standard generalized markup language. It is also a specification, a standard,
which marks every part of the webpage to be displayed by marking symbols. Web file is a text file. By adding tags in text files, it can
tell browsers how to display contents, such as how to process text, how to arrange pictures, how to display pictures, etc. Read the page
 file browser in order, then according to the marker interpretation and displays the contents of the tag, tag of writing error will not
  point out the wrong, and not to stop its interpretation of the implementation process, compiled only through display effect to analyze the
   cause of the error and error location. But it should be noted that for different browsers, there may be different interpretations for the
    same marker, so it may show different display effects. </p>
